    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instructor: Professor Henry Tucker. Textbook: Algebra by Michael Artin (Classic version). Topics include some review of linear algebra, groups, groups action, group representation (so far). It’s my first attempt to type lecture notes in LaTex sychronously with the help of vimTex and Snippets.</p><h3 id="Class-files"><a href="#Class-files" class="headerlink" title="Class files"></a>Class files</h3><p>This lecture note (<a href="./410lecturesM1.pdf">here</a>), covering everything before the first midterm, includes a quick review of vector space and linear algebra, then follows the structure of Artin’s Chapter 2 from groups and subgroups to quotient group. When talking about group operations, the lecture doesn’t use the original order in Artin’s textbook. So plz only use Artin’s as a reference (wiki is also a good reference for these fundamental group concepts). The lecture notes for second midterm <a href="410lecturesM2.pdf">here</a> is still in editing.</p>]]></content>
