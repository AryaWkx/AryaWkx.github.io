The hardest part is to make yourself familiar enough with the definitions and properties of the objects mentioned. So the basic techniques for this class is to spend enought time reading the fundamental definition and properties again and again so that you’re equiped with some intuition to understand more complicated theorems. For me, this course is easier than analysis because your intuition is usually in the right direction (as long as you build one). But in analysis, we usually have to prove our intuition is wrong in some way.<br>Well, besides the topic, the professor might also be a reason for my positive impression to algebra. I would definitely recommend others to take his course. The professor sometimes talked really fast in class (i.e trying to prove a big theorem within the last five minutes of class XD), but his intuition was quite helpful. Again, intuition played quite important role in this class which helps me build up the system of group and ring. And that’s Henry’s biggest advantage.<br>Though, I will always remember the nights I spent on doing homeworks, especially those homework that dues one day before midterm&#x2F;final. I was about to cry because I felt like I know nothing. But his exams gave me confident and things became much clearer when I re-read those homework answers.</p>]]></content>
